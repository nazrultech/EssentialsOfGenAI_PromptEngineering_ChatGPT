Provide just the sentiment of the following reviews:
1. “I recently watched 'Eternal Visions' a film that was decent overall. The storyline had an interesting mix of mystery and romance, but it felt somewhat predictable at times. 
The acting was good with the cast delivering solid performances though nothing particularly stood out. The visuals were nice with some beautiful scenes, but they weren't as captivating as I had hoped. The score was fine fitting the film's atmosphere, but it didn't leave a lasting impression on me. In summary, 'Eternal Visions' is an okay movie that might be worth a watch, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations."
2. “I just finished reading 'The Nightingale' by Kristin Hannah, and I was absolutely blown away. The storytelling was captivating from start to finish, weaving together historical events with deeply relatable characters. I found myself completely immersed in the lives of Vianne and Isabelle, unable to put the book down. The emotional depth and raw honesty of the narrative left a lasting impact on me. I highly recommend 'The Nightingale' to anyone looking for a powerful and unforgettable 
read.”
3. "I had high hopes for the new restaurant in town but unfortunately my experience was disappointing. The ambiance was nice, but the service was incredibly slow, and the staff seemed indifferent. The food was mediocre at best, lacking flavor and creativity. Additionally, the prices were exorbitant for what we received. Overall, I wouldn't recommend dining at this establishment unless significant improvements are made."
4. "The latest update of the app left me with mixed feelings. While I appreciate the new features and smoother interface, I'm frustrated with the increased battery consumption and the occasional bugs that disrupt my experience."
